## Error 
  
  File "/home/tata/tarik/analytics api/venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/psycopg/connection.py", line 120, in connect
    raise last_ex.with_traceback(None)
sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (psycopg.OperationalError) connection failed: connection to server at "127.0.0.1", port 5432 failed: Connection refused
        Is the server running on that host and accepting TCP/IP connections?


## solution
fix the host port in .env and up the only db in docker fixed this
