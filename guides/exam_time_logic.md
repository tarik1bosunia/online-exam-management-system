# 🕒 Exam Timing Logic (Clear & Visual Explanation)

This guide explains exactly how **Start Time**, **End Time**, and **Duration** work together in your Online Exam System.

---

## ⭐ 1. Meaning of the Fields

These three fields define how long the exam stays open and how long each student gets.

### **Start Time**

* The moment the exam becomes **visible** and **startable**.
* Before this time → students cannot access the exam.

### **End Time**

* The moment the exam **closes**.
* After this time → no new attempt can be started.

### **Duration (Minutes)**

* A **personal countdown timer** for each student.
* Starts only when the student clicks **Start Exam**.

## ⭐ 2. How the Exam Actually Works (The Logic)

You asked: “**Student can give exam any time — which one you follow?**”

✅ **Yes — students can start any time within the window.**

Here’s how:

---

### 🔶 **A. The Exam Window (Start → End Time)**

Think of this as the exam's **open hours**.

Example:

* **Start Time:** 9:00 AM
* **End Time:** 5:00 PM

➜ The exam stays open for **8 hours**.

A student may start at:

* 10:00 AM
* 1:00 PM
* 4:00 PM

As long as they start **before 5:00 PM**, it’s allowed.

---

### 🔶 **B. The Duration (Student’s Countdown)**

This is the **individual time limit per student**.

Example:

* **Duration:** 60 minutes

What happens:

* Student A starts at **10:00 AM** → must finish by **11:00 AM**.
* Student B starts at **1:00 PM** → must finish by **2:00 PM**.

⏳ **Each student gets their own timer**, independent of others.

## ⭐ 3. Visual Summary Table

| Field          | Meaning          | Example |
| -------------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| **Start Time** | Doors Open       | 9:00 AM |
| **End Time**   | Doors Close      | 5:00 PM |
| **Duration**   | Time per student | 60 mins |

## 🎯 Final Understanding

* The **exam window** defines *when* students are allowed to start.
* The **duration** defines *how long* each student gets.
* Both work together to ensure flexibility *and* fairness.
